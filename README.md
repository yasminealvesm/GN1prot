# PhD Project: Proteomics Data Processing

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of my PhD project, where I share the codes used for the processing and analysis of proteomics data. 
The codes provided here were developed to facilitate the manipulation and interpretation of data obtained during my research.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
* /scripts: Contains the scripts used for data processing.
* /datasets: Stores example datasets or input data required to run the scripts.
* /results: Directory intended to store results generated from data processing.

## Prerequisites
To run the codes in this project, it is necessary to have installed pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.
